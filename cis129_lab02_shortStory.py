print ("One day a man walked in the rain. He was intrigued when he witnessed a drop of rain hit a puddle in front of him.")
print ("He witnessed waves crash back and forth in the puddle, and it made him think of great large waves in the ocean!")
print ("He thought \"This puddle is no different than the world's vast oceans!\"")
print ("The man continued walking, now feeling better about the world")
print ("For the man believes that big or small, we can all achieve what we set our mind to. ")
